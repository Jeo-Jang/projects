# 🛠️ Engineering & Architecture Portfolio

> ### ⭐ Value-First Strategic Overview
>
> My expertise lies in translating workflow bottlenecks into measurable business impact using GenAI and Automation. I engineer systems that are not just technically sound, but designed to drive efficiency and compliance.
>
> * **Time Savings:** Built the internal GenAI Hub from scratch, establishing its vector database and driving user adoption which reduced initial research time by **50%** for design and strategy teams.
> * **Compliance & Security:** Architected the Hub to strict **GDPR** standards with AES-256 encryption and role-based access control.
> * **Workflow Mapping:** All solutions are developed with a **Human-Centric** philosophy, ensuring tools map directly to established business processes.
>
> This repository documents the architecture and design patterns behind these solutions. It is a **living document** that grows alongside my work.

## 🏗️ Design Philosophy
My work is driven by one goal: bridging the gap between **unstructured creative workflows** and **structured engineering systems**.

1.  **Value-First Architecture:** System design is prioritized over raw script volume. This repo documents architecture (Mermaid diagrams, Data Flows) to show *why* solutions were built.
2.  **Security by Design:** Whether building agents or integrations, security (GDPR, Auth) is baked in from day one, not patched on later.
3.  **The Underestimated Cost:** I design systems with **Human-in-the-Loop (HIL)** thinking to address the common flaw of underestimating the human time required for AI verification. Solutions must minimize the "Evaluation Tax"—the manual effort needed to validate and approve AI output for high-stakes professional use.

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This portfolio is currently under active construction.
* **Currently Uploading:** Detailed documentation for the *Indeed AI Toolbox*.
* **Next Up:** n8n workflow schemas and documentation for Google ADK/BigQuery data synchronization.

*Last Updated: December 2025*
