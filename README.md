# 🛠️ Engineering & Architecture Portfolio

> **Welcome.** This repository serves as a centralized collection of technical documentation, architectural patterns, and system designs for the platforms I have engineered.
>
> It is a **living document** that grows alongside my work in Generative AI, Business Process Automation, and Data System Architecture.

## 🏗️ Design Philosophy
My work focuses on bridging the gap between **unstructured creative workflows** and **structured engineering systems**.

1.  **Architecture First:** Code is easy; system design is hard. This repo prioritizes architectural clarity (Mermaid diagrams, Data Flows) over raw script dumping.
2.  **Security by Design:** Whether it's an AI Agent or a simple automation, security (GDPR, Auth) is baked in from day one.
3.  **Human-Centric Automation:** Tools are built to map actual human workflows, not just to demo technology.

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This portfolio is currently under active construction.
* **Currently Uploading:** Detailed documentation for the *Indeed AI Toolbox*.
* **Next Up:** n8n workflow schemas and documentation for Google ADK/BigQuery data synchronization.

*Last Updated: December 2025*
